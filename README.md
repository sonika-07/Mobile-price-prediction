In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and the factors which drive the prices. The objective is to find out some relation between the features of a mobile phone(e.g.:- RAM, Internal Memory, etc.) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.
